Hey! :)

My name is Viktória Nemkin, I'm a PhD student at BME VIK SZIT, you can email
me at [nemkin@cs.bme.hu](mailto:nemkin@cs.bme.hu) with any questions you have!

We are a competitive programming student club for BME students, mainly I'm
the person organizing our activities.

I you're interested in participating, there are multiple ways you can do that:

## Join us on Discord

</ul>

## Intro video series

We are currently working on an introductory video series, designed to help
students who have not yet done competitive programming to get up to speed on
the topic.

This assumes basic knowledge of algorithms, data structures and the C++ programming
language, so it is mainly aimed at 2nd year software engineering students, who have
already taken
[ITC1](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VISZAA03/en/),
[ITC2](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VISZAA04/en/),
[ThAlg](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VISZAA08/en/),
[Prog1](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VIEEAA00/en/) and
[Prog2](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VIAUAA01/en/)
(for the Hungarians, these are
[BSZ1](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VISZAA03/hu/),
[BSZ2](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VISZAA04/hu/),
[Algel](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VISZAA08/hu/),
[Prog1](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VIEEAA00/hu/) and
[Prog2](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VIAUAA01/hu/)
)
. If you're a determined first year student, reach out to me and
I can help you find materials to cover any missing gaps!

In the video series we give out weekly homeworks that you can submit on
Discord and discuss any question you have with me and the others.
You can watch and submit the homeworks from the past weeks as well,
our goal is for this to be an ongoing series that newcomers can
start doing whenever they would like, completely async.

For more details, watch the first video here:

You can find the rest of the series on our youtube channel
[@bmevprog](https://www.youtube.com/@bmevprog).

And you can also follow us on our social media! :)

## Codeforces contests

You can join us on competing against each other on current Codeforces contests!
You can take up the @codeforces role, so you'll be notified of all contests
happening.

You can do this when you join the server by answering the onboarding questions:

Or you can also do this later in the Channels & Roles section:

I recently did a recording on one of those contests, if you're interested in
what it looks like, you can check it out here: (I've made some mistakes, lol.)

## Live advanced meetings

We have live advanced meetings at BME, room IB134 every Tuesday from 6 pm.
Right now we are solving ICPC CERC exercises from Kattis to prepare for the
upcoming ICPC contest, like
[these](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/Central%20Europe%20Regional%20Contest%20(CERC)%202014).

If you have former competitive programming experience (i.e. you've participated
in Nemes Tihamér, OKTV, CEOI, IOI or Codeforces contests in the past), this is
definitely your place!

We use the [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/navigation.html) site
as a resource on more advanced data structures and algorithms. This contains
more than you need, but our intro video series does not cover everything yet
(we're still working on it :) ).

Hope to see you around! :)

## Competing in ICPC

If you get into competitive programming, the most important contest you'll
go to during your college years is ICPC. I'm also currently the ICPC coach
for BME and one of the people who organizes the registration of the BME
teams to ICPC Hungary and travel for our delegated teams to ICPC CERC.

The BME ICPC website is [https://cs.bme.hu/icpc](https://cs.bme.hu/icpc),
you can find all ICPC-related news here.

Hope to see you around! :)

Best,
Viktória
